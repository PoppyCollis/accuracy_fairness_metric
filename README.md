# accuracy_fairness_metric
We propose a selection criterion which allows us to obtain machine learning models with both high fairness and high accuracy.

Given the uncertainty surrounding the subject of algoritmic fairness, we therefore aim to investigate the apparent trade-off between accuracy 
and fairness by comparing the effect of regularisation strength on both. 

We first investigate this in the context of standard machine learning models, before going on to analyse how this model selection strategy might
change with fairness-based algorithms. Finally, we propose a selection criterion which allows us to obtain models with both high fairness and high accuracy.
